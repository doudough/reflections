What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?
metadata created in .git

How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? What value do you think it offers?
commit will be a snapshot of the staging area, we can keep untracked changes in the working directory

How can you use the staging area to make sure you have one commit per logical change?
only add to staging area when logical bundle is done
